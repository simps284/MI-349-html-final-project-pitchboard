    <h3>Title</h3>
    <p>Personal Portfolio: Joe Simpson</p>
    <h3>Short Pitch</h3>
    <p>This website will be a way for me to showcase my skills to potential employers</p>
    <h3>Long Pitch</h3>
    <p>Game development is a complicated field with many different disciplines coming together to make a product. Because of this, it is important to find a role to specialize in and demonstrate that you have the skills to fulfill that role. The purpose of this portfolio website will be to showcase my work in the game development program at MSU to show potential employers that I have the potential to contribute as a designer on any game dev team. This way employers will know not only what I aim to do at the company, but that I have the skills to do it.</p>
